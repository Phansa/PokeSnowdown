##Poke
Our group has all installed the virtual machine necessary to run the Pokemon Snowdown program
and we have started looking at the basics of OCaml. We have identified things to change in 
the current project such as
adding new moves, fixing the button graphics and adding new NPC's to the tournament mode.
