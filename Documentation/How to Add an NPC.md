Before anything, make sure you are running a virtual machine that can run the game. You can instructions on how to do so in the "How to Install Pokémon Snowdown" guide. 
This guide is assuming you have cloned the repository from https://github.com/Phansa/PokeSnowdown or https://github.com/maZang/PokeSnowdown and have basic knowledge about how linux works. 
Adding an NPC to the Pokémon Snowdown game is a great way to contribute to this project!  Just follow these steps and you be will on your way to making your own NPC in this game and hopefully getting it accepted into the main project!
For this example we will be adding Bob.npc.  If you look in the tournament.mli file you will find him there.  You will need an image edition program, for this example I will be using Paint.Net which you can find here.

You will also need a sprite and trainer "portrait".  You can find sprite sheets for trainers online.
